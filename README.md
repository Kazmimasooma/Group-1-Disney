## Project Overview

## Why we selected this topic

## Decomposing the Ask
Think from business point of view. Example of what our system can produce:-
1. Customer segmentation:
* With the data we have, we can “discover” user preferences and toys sales, and therefore use this information for ToysRus toy product placement. Eg: Lion King merchandise beside Toy Story merchandise as we discovered that people who like Lion King also like Toy Story. If the genre are both “Adventure”, then we can also suggest that the toy merchandise include something like “adventure game” and not just soft toys.
* With the customer segmentation, Disney new releases can be advertised on IMDB & Rotten Tomatoes to "look alike" customers. Therefore Disney is spending the marketing ads funds in a targeted manner.
* Disney Park revenue:- the same can be said about park. Fast pass for Lion King & Toy Story as the same people like both movies. OR let’s say both of these are under “Adventure” genre, then we can say, the new Toy Story in Disney park should be an adventure ride and not like “It’s A Small World” ride.
* Disney Park revenue:- We can use our dataset to make informed decisions about the disney park rides. We can put Lion King & Toy Story themed rides beside each other. In addition, as the movie genre was adventure. The rides can be designed to be more thrilling instead of easy going, as they will appeal more to an adventerous demographic.
