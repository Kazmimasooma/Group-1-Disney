# Group-1-Project-Movie-Recommendation-System

## Overview / Decomposing the Ask

Building a recommendation system to suggest movies (genres) to users based on preferences. ← This is really difficult because we also need to build:
* User input interface: ask user questions in order to see what the like. Can be decision tree version:  “Do you like animals?” - Y | N, “Do you like Adventure?” - Y | N
* Output interface: looks like a Netflix output system? Have to use Flask-Bootstrap.
* Therefore this can get complicated with the additional requirements above.


### Other Questions:
Example of what our system can produce:-
1. Customer segmentation:
* With the data we have, we can “discover” user preferences and toys sales, and therefore use this information for ToysRus toy product placement. Eg: Lion King merchandise beside Toy Story merchandise as we discovered that people who like Lion King also like Toy Story. If the genre are both “Adventure”, then we can also suggest that the toy merchandise include something like “adventure game” and not just soft toys.

* Disney Park revenue:- the same can be said about park. Fast pass for Lion King & Toy Story as the same people like both movies. OR let’s say both of these are under “Adventure” genre, then we can say, the new Toy Story in Disney park should be an adventure ride and not like “It’s A Small World” ride.
